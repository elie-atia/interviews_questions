You have an interface where packets arrive with a priority field that receives a value between 0 and 3 (a whole number). You need to apply get_packet
and insert_packet functions in the following way:

--> get_packet: outputs the packet with the lowest priority. And if two packet have the same priority value, then the function outputs the packet that
arrived first.
--> insert_patcket: simply adds a packet to the array.

Requirements: This must be realized by using one array. How can it be optimized?
